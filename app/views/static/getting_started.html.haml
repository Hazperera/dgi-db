            provided citations to support these definitions. Many of the resources we curate do not provide their own
            definitions of these terms, and so we encourage users of DGIdb to use these definitions as a starting point,

                  In a partial antagonist interaction, a drug will only partially reduce the amplitude of a functional
                  response at its target receptor, as compared to the reduction of response by a full antagonist.
