              A finding of a drug-gene interaction or potentially druggable category does not necessarily indicate effectiveness (or lack thereof) of any drug or treatment regimen. A finding of no interaction or no potentially druggable category does not necessarily indicate lack of effectiveness of any drug or treatment regimen. Drug-gene interactions or potentially druggable categories are not presented in ranked order of potential or predicted efficacy.
